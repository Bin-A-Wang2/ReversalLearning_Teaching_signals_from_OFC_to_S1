This repository contains the custom Matlab codes used to produce the results for the manuscript entitled 'Human orbitofrontal cortex signals outcome values to sensory cortex during flexible decision-making' published in Nature Communications by Wang et al.,

The successful running of these codes needs some other toolbox, i.e., SPM (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/), RSA (https://github.com/rsagroup/rsatoolbox_matlab), gPPI (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/gppi) and TAPAS (https://github.com/translationalneuromodeling/tapas).
